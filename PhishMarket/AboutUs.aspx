            About Me</h3>
        I am just a Phan that loves to give back to the community. I have been listening
        to Phish since 2000, but that was when I was finally introduced to it. I wish it
        had happened sooner than 15 years old. I loved them and just when I began to understand,
        they went on Hiatus. It really hurt me but made me spend so much time researching
        old shows and listening to what makes them so unique.
        <br />
        <br />
        So naturally my first shows were in 2003/2004 when I finally got a chance. I was
        only able to make it to 2 shows each year thinking they would be back for a while.
        I was a college student and didn't have enough money to go on tour and just took
        what I could get. Then again they left me for a final break and I wished I had more
        time. I was destroyed.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2009 when I heared that they were coming back I couldn't believe it was happening.
        I finally had a job and enough time off that I could see them how I really wanted.
        I saw them 12 times in 2009 but it wasn't enough, it barely scratched the itch.
        In 2010 I will have seen 20 shows if you count NYE run. What a great year but I
        can't wait to see more.
        <br />
        <br />
        I LOVE PHISH!

        <h3>
            Objective</h3>
        I want to create a community that the other sites don't really offer. <b>I do not want
            to replace, I want to supplement what is already there.</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        What I want is to create a directed conversation about Phish to find out stats that
        improve and help the community. I want to find out the favorite verions of every
        song through each user voting on their profile. You can rate the show and leave
        your review. But in the Phorum I want the discussion to be a place to go into real
        detail why it is the best version.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another goal is to see peoples' collection of posters, ticket stubs, and art. It
        will see what is out there, who has the best collections, and just to show amazing
        art to as many people as possible. So please help me make this dream come true.
