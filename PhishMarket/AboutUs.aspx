            About Me</h3>
        I am just a Phan that loves to give back to the community. I have been listening
        to Phish since 2000, but that was when I was finally introduced to it. I wish it
        had happened sooner than 15 years old. I loved them and just when I began to appreciate,
        they went on Hiatus. It really hurt me but made me spend so much time researching
        old shows and listening to what makes them so unique.
        <br />
        <br />
        So naturally my first shows were in 2003/2004 when I finally got a chance. I was
        only able to make it to 2 shows each year. I was a college student and didn't have
        enough money to go on tour and just took what I could get. Then again they left
        me for a 'final' break and I wished I had more time. I was destroyed.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2009 when I heard that they were coming back I couldn't believe it was happening.
        I finally had a job and enough time off that I could see them. I saw them 12 times
        in 2009 but it wasn't enough, it barely scratched the itch. In 2010 I saw 19 shows
        and felt like they were finally coming into their own again. What a great year but
        I can't wait to see more.
        <br />
        <br />
        I LOVE PHISH!

        <h3>
            Objective</h3>
        I want to create a community that the other sites don't really offer. <b>I do not want
            to replace, I want to supplement what is already there.</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        What I want is to create a directed conversation about Phish to find out stats that
        improve and help the community. You can rate the show and leave your review for
        each show. But in the Phorum the discussion can let you go into real detail why
        it is the best version, set, show, or year with others.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another goal is to give people who weren't there a chance to feel what it was like.
        This works through adding pictures and posters from the show to your profile. It
        will show what it looked like from multiple perspectives to help relive the experience.
        So please help me make this dream come true.
